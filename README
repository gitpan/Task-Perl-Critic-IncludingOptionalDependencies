    WARNING: Installing this distribution will install Policies that
    directly conflict with each other. If you do not use a .perlcriticrc
    file, and your severity is set high enough, there is no way for your
    code to not have violations. A specific example:
    Perl::Critic::Policy::Compatibility::ProhibitThreeArgumentOpen and
    Perl::Critic::Policy::InputOutput::ProhibitTwoArgOpen directly
    contradict each other.
